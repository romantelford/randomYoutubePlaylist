# What it does
	Youtube was only able to have a playlist of 200 videos. This solves that.
	Youtube would shuffle the videos completely randomly, which is what you want 90% of the time. But when you have a playlist of music videos, you could find yourself watching videos from the same artist back to back, multiple times if the RNG gods are not in your favour. So this tries to fix that by making sure videos by the same artist wont appear back to back or close to each other.
